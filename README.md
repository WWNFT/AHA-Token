# AHA Token

This is the official repo for the AHA token. Here are some properties of the AHA token:

- Name: ArtistsHelpArtists
- Symbol: AHA
- Non-transferable: All AHA are bound to the wallet and not transferable to other wallets, unless whitelisted.
  - Normally the whitelist is reserved for official redeem shop for converting to Badge or NFTs. This is to be decided.
- Come with standard snapshot provided by OpenZeppelin just in case we need manual voting.
- Come with Polygon-Eth cross-chain interfaces. As of now, there is still some issues on the PoS Bridge and we are currently working with Polygon support to address the issue. Stay tuned for more updates

# Compile
